# Kafka Streams

## Table Of Contents

- **Kafka Streams** is a client-side library built on top of **Apache Kafka**. It enables the processing of an unbounded stream of events in a declarative manner.
- **Kafka Streams** provides a duality between **Kafka topics** and relational database tables. It enables us to do operations like **joins**, **grouping**, **aggregation**, and **filtering** of one or more streaming events.
- Events can be kept in **KStream** or **KTable** in the **Kafka Streams** applications in **key-value** pair format. The difference between a **stream** and a **table** is; a **stream** is an endless flow of data but a **table** is an abstraction of a **stream**.
