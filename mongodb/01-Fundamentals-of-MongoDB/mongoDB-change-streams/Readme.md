# MongoDB Change Streams

## Table Of Contents

- **Change streams** allow applications a direct interface in real time to deal with change in database collections, with powerful features to custom **event-driven architectures**. These streams offer a unified interface to subscribe to various types of changes, including document insertions, updates, deletions, and database and collection–level events.

# What are MongoDB Change Streams?

- **MongoDB** change streams provide a way to watch changes occurring in a MongoDB database in real–time. It allows applications to react to these changes as they happen, making it an ideal tool for building real-time event-driven systems.

#

- **Change streams** are available in **MongoDB** when a **replica set environment is configured**. To utilize **change streams** in a local development environment, we configure a replica set using **Docker Compose**.

# Prerequisites

- In order to use **Change Streams**, one must use a distributed database, referred to as the **replica set**, which is very well facilitated in **MongoDB**.

# Where to Use Change Streams?

1. **Real-time Analytics**: **Change Streams** are valuable for real-time data analysis, allowing immediate response to data changes.
2. Data Replication: They can be used to replicate data changes across multiple systems or databases in real-time.
3. Synchronization Across Distributed Systems: Change Streams help keep distributed systems synchronized by propagating changes instantly.
4. Building Event-Driven Architectures: They are essential for building event-driven systems where actions are triggered based on database changes.
5. Immediate Notification Systems: Change Streams are useful for applications requiring immediate notification or action based on database changes

# MongoDB Change Streams Features

1. Change Stream Aggregation: MongoDB Change Streams return a stream of change events in a format that resembles MongoDB aggregation pipelines. This allows developers to apply powerful transformations and filters to the incoming change events.
2. Resumability: Change Streams maintain a resume token, which allows applications to resume listening for changes from the point where they left off. This ensures fault tolerance and consistency in event processing.
3. Scalability: MongoDB Change Streams are designed to scale efficiently, making them suitable for high-throughput applications. They can be deployed in a sharded cluster environment, distributing the load across multiple nodes.
4. Integration Flexibility: Change Streams can be seamlessly integrated with various programming languages and frameworks through MongoDB drivers, enabling developers to build event-driven architectures in their preferred tech stack.

# How to Use Change Streams?

- Setting Up a Pipeline: Involves creating a pipeline to monitor changes in MongoDB.
- Reacting to Changes: Requires implementing code to respond to those changes in the application.
- APIs for Managing Change Streams: MongoDB drivers offer APIs for establishing and managing change streams.
- Subscription to Relevant Changes: Developers can subscribe to specific changes based on their application’s requirements.
- Processing Changes: Developers can process these changes as needed in their application logic.
