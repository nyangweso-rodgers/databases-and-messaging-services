# MongoDB Concepts

1. **MongoDB Server**:
   - this is a server-side component which can host multiple databases.
2. A **MongoDB database**:
   - this is a physical container of collections.
3. A **Collection**:
   - in **MongoDB** is equivalent to a relational database table and it exists within a single database.
   - It includes a group of **MongoDB** documents.
4. **Document**:
   - includes a set of `key` `value` pairs.
   - All documents include a dynamic schema which means documents which comprise of same collection do not need to have same set of fields and structure.
5. **Replica Sets**: are a set of a few connected mongodb instances that store the same data.
