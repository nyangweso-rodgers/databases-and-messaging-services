# How to run MongoDB

- Two common ways to run **MongoDB** include:

  1. "MongoDB Atlas," and
  2. Locally Installed MongoDB.

- You can download a free **MongoDB database** at https://www.mongodb.com Or get started right away with a **MongoDB cloud service** at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.

# Installing MongoDB on Windows

- Download the **MongoDB installer** from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
- After you download the installer, you install MongoDB following the instructions of the installer.
- For Most operating systems we use **MongoDB Community Edition**. It's free, and by now it's also all you need.

# MongoDB Atlas

- **MongoDB Atlas** is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of _deploying_, _managing_, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS , Azure, and GCP)

## MongoDB Atlas Free Cluster

- Atlas free clusters provide a small-scale development environment to host your data.
- Free clusters never expire, and provide access to a subset of Atlas features and functionality.
- Under the free tier youâ€™ll have access to a subset of Atlas features, like
  - Charts and
  - Realm
- Paid clusters provide full access to Atlas features, configuration options, and operational capabilities.
- You can create and [Deploy a Free Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/) by first going to [MongoDB Atlas registration page](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_atlas&_ga=2.33670369.1905865679.1639760133-686843528.1638558648)
- Follow the below steps to create a free cluster:

  1. Click on Build a Cluster
  2. Click on Create a Cluster

- Next Step is to create a user to access the cluster , this is different from the user you created at the beginning, this new user is for database access, the previous one was for MongoDB Atlas platform administration.
