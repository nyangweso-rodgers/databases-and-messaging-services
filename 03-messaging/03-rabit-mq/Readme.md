# What is RabbitMQ?

- **RabbitMQ** is an open-source **message broker** that implements the **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol** (AMQP) standard. It is written in **Erlang** and designed for high-throughput, low-latency messaging.
- **RabbitMQ** supports multiple messaging patterns such as publish/subscribe, request/reply, and point-to-point, and it has a robust set of features such as message acknowledgment, routing, and queuing.
